Warning message:
UNRELIABLE VALUE: Future (‘<none>’) unexpectedly generated random numbers without specifying argument 'seed'. There is a risk that those random numbers are not statistically sound and the overall results might be invalid. To fix this, specify 'seed=TRUE'. This ensures that proper, parallel-safe random numbers are produced via the L'Ecuyer-CMRG method. To disable this check, use 'seed=NULL', or set option 'future.rng.onMisuse' to "ignore".

Warning message:
UNRELIABLE VALUE: Future (‘<none>’) unexpectedly generated random numbers without specifying argument 'seed'. There is a risk that those random numbers are not statistically sound and the overall results might be invalid. To fix this, specify 'seed=TRUE'. This ensures that proper, parallel-safe random numbers are produced via the L'Ecuyer-CMRG method. To disable this check, use 'seed=NULL', or set option 'future.rng.onMisuse' to "ignore".

Warning messages:
1: In ci.auc.roc(roc, ...) :
  ci.auc() of a ROC curve with AUC == 1 is always 1-1 and can be misleading.
2: In ci.auc.roc(roc, ...) :
  ci.auc() of a ROC curve with AUC == 1 is always 1-1 and can be misleading.
3: In ci.auc.roc(roc, ...) :
  ci.auc() of a ROC curve with AUC == 1 is always 1-1 and can be misleading.
4: In ci.auc.roc(roc, ...) :
  ci.auc() of a ROC curve with AUC == 1 is always 1-1 and can be misleading.
5: UNRELIABLE VALUE: Future (‘<none>’) unexpectedly generated random numbers without specifying argument 'seed'. There is a risk that those random numbers are not statistically sound and the overall results might be invalid. To fix this, specify 'seed=TRUE'. This ensures that proper, parallel-safe random numbers are produced via the L'Ecuyer-CMRG method. To disable this check, use 'seed=NULL', or set option 'future.rng.onMisuse' to "ignore".
